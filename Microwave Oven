A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the recommended heating time.

Sample Input and Output :

Enter the number of items

2

Enter the single item heating time

5.0

The recommended heating time is 7.50


print("Enter the number of items")
A=int(input())
print("Enter the single item heating time")
B=float(input())
X=B+(50/100)*B
Y=B+2*B
if A==2:
    print("The recommended heating time is %.2f"%X)
elif A==3:
    print("The recommended heating time is %.2f"%Y)
else:
    print("Number of items is more")
