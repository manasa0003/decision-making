The newly appointed Vice Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create a automated grading system for the students to check their grade. When a student enter a mark, the grading system displays the corresponding grade.

Write a program to solve the given problem.

 

Marks scored          Grade
100                     S
(90,100)                A
(80,90)                 B
(70,80)                 C
(60,70)                 D
(50,60)                 E 
<50                     F
The interval [a,b) includes all numbers greater than or equal to a and less than b.

Sample Input:

85

Sample Output:

B


a=int(input())
if a==100:
    print("S")
elif a<100 and a>=90:
    print("A")
elif a<90 and a>=80:
    print("B")
elif a<80 and a>=70:
    print("C")
elif a<70 and a>=60:
    print("D")
elif a<60 and a>=50:
    print("E")
elif a<50:
    print("F")
else:
    print("invalid input")
